# Practice - coding:
# Create a Python file with the next classes:
# 1) Create the class "Zoo" with a protected list named "animals"
# 2) Add methods for adding and removing elements from the list.
# 3) Create classes for Wolf, Lion, Bioson, Parrtot, and Goose
# Each class should have fields: name(str), id(int) and constructor.
# Each class should have the method "play_sound()" which returns the string with the sound of the animal
# (Use "Roar" for wolf and lion, "Moo" for bison, and "honk" for goose and parrot).
# Create method which represents the current class object as a string e.g. output in print command should be like
# "class Lion name Alex id 2".
